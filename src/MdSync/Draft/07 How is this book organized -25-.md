 Part1 introduces the syntax and programming styles. We start with How, We use a series of « how can i do this in haskell », based on the way we were taught imperative programming. I cover in order: structured programming, OO concepts, agile and build environment.

The scope is basic haskell and covers the notions known in the imperative world.

Part 2  uses this knowledge and build iteratively a real world example of an accounting program, (inspired by hledger) where we discuss and comment practices, and caveat. We use and introduce some common libraries.

Part 3 introduces « intermediate haskell », i.e. Concepts that do not exists in imperative world.

We revisit our accounting program to use these new concepts.

The fourth part, or annex, is a cultural part. It present a Jargon file of the concepts we saw previously, useful to understand Q&A on stackexchange for instance, including a series of « programming styles » useful when reading Haskell code in libraries, then point at advanced Haskell concepts, just so you know they exists, and are « advanced » (and that you could live well without)
