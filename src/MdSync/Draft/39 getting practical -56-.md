Fitst, we talk about the problems specific to haskell, which may hinder Bob, Clara and Jo when starting.

Then we compile a few programs, refactor them from an imperative style to a more haskellish way, in order to master tools and techniques, and see what you do when the compiler complains.

Then we take a more ambitious program, the base for our ledger program. this provides the opportunity to put together the techniques we saw, plus a few new ones , and get acquainted with useful libraries.
