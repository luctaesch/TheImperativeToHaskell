This are the sources for the book "The Imperative To Haskell".

## FastTrack ##

- read the pdf in dist/the imperative to haskell.pdf

## Content ##


Currently, the organisation is as follow:

- src/ : the source directory
	- the imperative to haskell.scriv : the Master file in [scriverner] 
	- mdsync / : the directory of txt source files, synced with the scriverner master . these are Markdown file 

- dist :  the output of the compiled scrivener file.
	- current generated format : PDF	

- build : should we need some auto build  ( from md/ xsl / whatever), this will be there.
	- 	empty for now.

-  theRoadToTheImperativeToHaskell.taskpaper is a task list and journal of the making of (text file)

## Status ##
- the status of the sections is in : tbd

### Sync ###
- the master is the scrivener file
- the PDF is generated on demand, generally at the end of every session (typically after my daily commute : 9 am , 8pm )
- the md is synced automatically at every open/close of scrivener . which may stay open for one or two weeks:-) / . and on demand;
- the git push  is currently manual

when contributors will become active, or request it, I'll sync to MD and git push bi daily. for now, this is ad hoc.

## Contribution ##

- whoever fancy contributing is welcome. 
you can contribute comments, detail reviews or content, new or updates.
- the mailist is there to share and provide archive. 
- the md directory enable to do direct modification of the content.
